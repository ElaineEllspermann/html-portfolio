<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Duke</h3>
<p>A charming, understated and completely enjoyable frolic <br>
   about how ordinary people can do extraordinary things <br>
   that seems doubly startling because, while seeming implausible,<br>
  it also happens to be absolutely true.
</p>

<h3>The Great Freedom</h3>
<p>
  A quiet and carefully constructed story <br>
  about the sheer absurdity of the criminalisation of homosexuality,<br>
  and about the denial of humanity that criminalisation required.
</p>

<h3> Top Gun: Maverick </h3>

<p>
  The return of pure, nostalgic blockbusters.<br>
  The best aerial action sequences ever amaze even the highest expectations,<br>
  not only due to the absolutely insane real stunts but largely because of the <br>
  flawless contribution of all filmmaking elements.
